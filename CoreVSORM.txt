SQLAlchemy provides two primary approaches for interacting with databases: 
SQLAlchemy Core and SQLAlchemy ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). 
Here's a brief overview of the differences between the two:

SQLAlchemy Core:

Description: Core is a lower-level, SQL-centric library that allows you to interact with databases using SQL expressions directly. 
It provides a set of tools for building and executing SQL statements without the need for an object-relational mapping.

Usage: You define tables, columns, and relationships using the Table and Column classes. 
SQL expressions are created using functions like select, insert, update, and delete. You work directly with SQL constructs and have more control over the generated SQL.


SQLAlchemy ORM:

Description: ORM is a higher-level, Pythonic way of interacting with databases. 
It allows you to map Python objects to database tables, and it handles the translation between the object-oriented world of Python and the relational world of databases.

Usage: You define your data models as Python classes, and SQLAlchemy takes care of creating the necessary tables and managing the database interactions. 
It provides a higher level of abstraction, making it more convenient and Pythonic.





Use Core When:

You prefer working with raw SQL expressions and want fine-grained control over SQL statements.
Your application requirements are more SQL-centric.
You want a lightweight solution without the overhead of mapping Python objects to database tables.

Use ORM When:
You want to work with a more Pythonic, object-oriented interface.
You prefer a higher level of abstraction and automatic handling of database operations.
Your application involves complex relationships and requires an object-relational mapping.
In many cases, projects use a combination of both Core and ORM, depending on the specific requirements and preferences of the developers.
